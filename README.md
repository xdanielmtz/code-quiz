# code-quiz

In this recent project, I have built a timed coding quiz with multiple choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically update HTML and CSS powered by Javascript code that I have written. It has a clean, responsive user interface. 


## Installation of Repo

Follow these steps to view my project!

1. Open link in github. - https://github.com/xdanielmtz/code-quiz
2. Clone with SSH
3. Run "git clone" command in Terminal with the pasted link
4. Run "code ." command to open in VS Code.
5. Enjoy.


## What will you find in this repo?

- An index.html (The web application itself)
- CSS sheet 
- Javascript page
- A decent readme.


## Upon opening the web application, you will notice: 
A start button.
When clicking the start button, the timer starts and you are presented with a question.
After answering the first question you are presented with the following question.
If you answer the question incorrectly, then you move onto the next question and your score is deducted by 5.
When all questions are over or the timer reaches 0, then the game is over.
When the game is over you can save your initials and score in local storage.
